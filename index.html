       <img src="images/qwell.jpg" alt="Qwell Project Image" class="qwell-image">
       <p class="kooth-description">Both posters explore themes of emotion, honesty, and support
         while reflecting the visual messages often seen in services like Kooth and Qwell.
          The first poster uses a darker, split-face design to show inner conflict and the 
          weight of dishonesty, while the second uses bright collage textures and repeated
           words like “HELP,” “HOPE,” and “WORTH” to express the importance of speaking up.
            Together, they show different emotional experiences while connecting to the 
            supportive and encouraging tone associated with Kooth and Qwell.</p>

        <img src="images/tb.png" alt="Treat Box Project Image" class="tb-image">
          <p class="tb-descripton">These two logo designs were created to visually express the 
          themes behind “Takeaway Fridays” and the “Treat Box,” using bold illustration and
           playful colour choices to suit each idea. The Takeaway Fridays logo features a 
           friendly chef and flowing handwritten text to create a warm, food-focused identity, 
           while the Treat Box logo uses a donut, utensils, and star elements for a fun,
           energetic feel that highlights enjoyment and reward. The added phrase 
          “You Deserve One” strengthens the message by making it more personal and encouraging,
             reinforcing the idea that everyone deserves a small treat at the end of the week.</p>

            Wise is a money-transfer and multi-currency app that makes it easy to send, spend,
            and save across borders with low fees and real exchange rates.
            It gives users a clear, convenient way to manage everyday finances—whether they’re sending money abroad,
            holding multiple currencies, or tracking spending on the Wise card.
            I redesigned the app to make these core features even easier to access and understand. 
            The goal was to create a smoother, more intuitive experience that supports Wise’s purpose
            : helping people move and manage their money confidently, without confusion or hidden costs.

<section id="aboutme">
    <h3 class="aboutme-header">About Me</h3>
     <p class="aboutme-description">I am a Year 2 Graphic Design student with a growing passion
         for software engineering and development. My interest in this started through the
          Wise project, which included design and creating interactive prototypes.
           Now, I am focused on building technical coding skills to support my transition 
           from design to tech and develop further. This portfolio is a great way to start
         coding work,
        and it was created by learning HTML & CSS from the basics and applying it.</p>
